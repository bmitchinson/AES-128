sorry about that, I forgot the .py extension to the file, thus giving you a bad link.

Here's what I meant to link: https://github.com/bmitchinson/AES-128/blob/master/decryptMessage.py
Only difference is it has `.py` at the end.

Hopefully this didn't cause too much confusion, 
since everything about the organization of this project is listed
in the root readme: https://github.com/bmitchinson/AES-128/blob/master/README.md
